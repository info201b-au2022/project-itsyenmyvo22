## **Abstract**
We are concerned with the amount of Gun Violence that is happening in the United States because of the recent events that occurred on University of Washington campus, and the effect gun violence has on families of victims. To address this concern, we can show the data visualization in order to have politicians take action to put more pressure on creating gun laws set in place and provide more safety for those who live in the US. With this, we can educate people about the need for gun control.
Keywords: Gun violence, gun laws, gun deaths, accidents, gun access

## **Introduction**
Since there have been a number of recent shootings near the UW campus, some of which even have threatened the lives of UW students, this has drawn our attention and concern. We were reminded of the gun violence cases that have occurred throughout the United States. Our project collects statistical data sets on gun violence, and analyzes them. We also analyze datasets on gun regulation and related laws. Through these aspects, we want to show the problem that the frequency of gun violence in the United States is related to the lack of relevant binding laws. Not only do we find that gun violence also highlights social and economic problems in the U.S., but the frequency of gun violence is also strongly correlated with poverty. We hope that through our project, we can first draw attention among UW students on a small scale, and later perhaps on a societal level.

## **Problem domain**
### What is the Problem Domain?

Gun violence addresses governmental issues. For instance, the national government has limited control over how guns can be regulated, therefore gun control laws are up to state leaders. Another social issue the problem domain brings up is the fact that a lot of gun violence stems from poverty. “Black and brown neighborhoods suffer higher rates of poverty, and violence concentrates around poverty” (Lopez).  Due to this, there is a social issue presented with the data, as many of the systemic inequalities that black people face center around the fact that there is limited generational wealth due to slavery, and thus are more likely to be impoverished. Because poverty allows for more violence, gun violence highlights the social and economic issues in the United States.

Another governmental issue is the fact that many politicians are funded by the National Rifle Association. “The N.R.A.’s millions-strong membership and deep-pocketed lobbying apparatus were unfairly holding Republican leaders hostage”(Russonello). This highlights the governmental issue as the NRA has lobbied and corrupted politicians to loosen gun control for their own personal benefit.
### Human Values
There’s a large portion of Americans who value the right to bear arms. Because they hold this value, it’s hard to get gun laws set in place. Certain individuals equate gun regulations to the removal of freedom. There was a poll conducted that showed “81 percent of Americans say the Second Amendment is very or somewhat important” (KCRG). Within the Second Amendment, “More than half of Americans say they believe the right to keep and bear arms is important” (KCRG). This thought is especially rooted in the ultra-patriotic mindset of people in the right wing of politics. Compared to Democrats, Republicans usually support the right to bear arms more. The Grinnell National Poll showed that “95 percent of Republicans say the amendment is important, but only 63 percent of Democrats say it’s important” (KCRG). This shows there is a tension in values between these two political parties. There is a disagreement in politics regarding the second amendment, which correlates to gun laws.

### Stakeholders
The direct stakeholders of our topic are the victims of gun violence and the potential people who may be threatened by guns. In the United States, gun violence affects everyone’s life. Each year, 3 million children are directly exposed to gun violence, resulting in death, injury, and lasting trauma.(GIFFORDS) A focus on gun violence can bring more attention to the victims of gun violence, and the vast statistics can make more people aware of how serious a matter gun violence is. The data can also be used to make the public more aware of self-protection and to put an end to all incidents of gun violence.
Indirect stakeholders are the government and gun manufacturers. The Giffords Law Center shows that the United States has the weakest gun laws and the most guns - 393 million - of any comparable country(GIFFORDS). This shows that the government needs to enact more laws regarding the restraint of firearms. By showing the statistics of gun violence incidents, our topic can draw the attention of the society as a way to cause the relevant government departments to make relevant laws. For the gun manufacturers, it can also be used to remind them that they should have detailed information about each gun transaction and reduce the sale of guns.

### Benefits and Harms
For benefits, if we intervene in the number of guns, the number of shootings will be reduced. That would also significantly reduce the number of people killed or injured in shootings. Also, It will make most of the citizens feel safe, they don't have to worry about walking down the street or at public places being shot at any time.
However, there are some harms to interventions. The first is for the government, whose tax revenue will be reduced by the reduction in gun sales. Likewise, gun manufacturers will see less revenue. They might pressure the government to cancel the intervention. In 2021, for example, Sturm, Ruger & Company, the largest publicly traded gun maker in the United States, made more than $280 million in profits. Similarly, Smith & Wesson Brands, the second-largest gunmaker, reported profits of nearly $450 million (Beyer). What’s more, there is a small minority of people who want freedom or who think guns can protect them who might object to this intervention. They might take to the streets and cause more chaos.

## **Research questions**
1. **_Has gun violence gotten worse over the years?_**
We need to see numerically the extent of gun violence and if it has risen to address the problem of how to prevent it. We also need this question to get a scope of just how prevalent gun violence is.


2. **_Which groups of people get affected by gun violence the most?_**
 This question is crucial because it gives us the demographics of those who are frequently having to face the consequences of present gun policies. If we find out this information, we can better evaluate which communities of people need help.

3. **_In states with greater gun control are there lower rates of gun violence?_**
 This question is important because our intended audience for this data set is politicians. We need to address this question to help provide evidence that gun control laws work. This question is important because gun control laws are highly controversial, and part of the reason is that there is not enough clear evidence of their effectiveness.

## **The Dataset**
### How the dataset is related:
For the first research question, we can get an idea directly of the amount, date, and location of gun violence in recent years from “Gun Violence Data”. So we can solve the first question that we studied.
For the second question, we can refer to the number of laws and specific control measures in the “Firearms Provisions in US States”. It can be compared to “Gun Violence Data” and “Sociological Metrics of all 50 States”  to see how effective these laws are in controlling the number of guns and gun violence in various places.
Although the third question cannot be obtained directly from the datasets, it can be obtained indirectly from the data of “Sociological Metrics of all 50 States”. In this dataset, we can compare Percent Educational attainment, The Percent Above Poverty Rate and the Percent Non-religious proportion compared with the Percent Peace Index. Then, it can be concluded that gun violence affects more people.

### Provenance of Data
The data called “US Police Shootings: Deep Analysis” was collected by Salman Faroz in 2020. The data set does not disclose where it got the funding, but people who are likely to benefit from the data are people who need evidence to demand police reform. The data called “Firearms Provisions in US States” is from 1991-2017 and collected by Jacob Boysen. The purpose is to show how firearm laws have changed throughout time. The data collection effort was funded from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Evidence for Action: Investigator-Initiated Research to Build a Culture of Health program (grant #73337), using data from the Thomson Reuters Westlaw legislative database. People who are likely to benefit from the data are people in the health field and those who study law.  The data set “Gun Violence Data” was collected by James Ko in 2018. It was mainly downloaded  from gunviolencearchive.org. Gun Violence Archive (GVA) is “a not for profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide free online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States.” Those who benefit from this data are people who need information on gun control.

The data titled “US Police Shootings: Deep Analysis” is from a Kaggle user named Salman Faroz. Their profile shows they are a datasets expert, which validates their data is proper. The same goes for the dataset titled “Sociological Metrics of all 50 States” from Rishi Damarla. For the dataset titled “Firearms Provisions in US States”, that’s from Jacob Boysen, the rank is datasets master. The dataset “Gun Violence Data” from James Ko has an unranked profile but the dataset has 881 upvotes. 100 of those upvotes are non-novice votes. This validates that the dataset is good for use. All four datasets are posted on Kaggle, which is where we obtained our data. Kaggle is used by data scientists and the majority of databases off Kaggle are credible. You can also view reliability by looking at upvotes and notebooks found on datasets.

## **Findings**
1. **_Has gun violence gotten worse over the years?_**
Through our research and analysis of the data, we can conclude that the answer to this question is yes, gun violence has increased over the years. As seen in the third visualization, the number of people killed and injured by shootings across the United States has trended upward every month since 2014, and the overall trend in the number of casualties has not shown a decline until 2018. The data tells us a clear answer and shows that gun violence is a problem that cannot be taken lightly.

2. **_In states with greater gun control are there lower rates of gun violence?_**
Using the graph of Universal Background Checks and Gun Deaths and the analysis of the boxplot of Amounts of Gun Deaths vs. Gun Control Law in effect, we find that states that lack gun control do have different rates of gun violence than states that have gun control. In general, mortality rates are lower in states that have implemented gun control laws with universal background checks, suggesting a correlation between gun control laws and the incidence of gun violence. That said, it is still difficult to conclude that the incidence of gun violence is necessarily lower in states with stronger gun control. This is because first of all our data visualization does not take into account population density. For example, in California, although it has strict gun control laws, it still has one of the highest gun violence death rates due to the high population density of dense large cities. We can conclude that violent crime tends to be lower in rural areas than in more populous metropolitan areas.

3. **_Which groups of people get affected by gun violence the most?_**
We found a number of factors that influence gun violence, such as the previously mentioned issue of whether or not to implement gun control laws with universal background checks, and the issue of population density that was not considered in the data. In addition to these, we also found a relationship between gun violence and poverty levels. Through data visualization and interactive charts, we found that states with higher poverty levels tend to have more gun deaths. In summary, the Midwest has fewer gun deaths, while the eastern states and states along the southern border have more gun deaths. So the answer is that some poor people and people who live in areas without gun control laws are more likely to be affected by gun violence.

## **Discussion**
We find it important to show the public, through more detailed and visual analysis, the frequency of gun violence, the need for stronger gun control laws, and the audience groups that are more vulnerable to gun violence. Gun violence in the United States shows that the price to be paid for having freedom is to face the casualties of the gun violence problem. Our findings will allow U.S. citizens to have a more detailed understanding of the gun violence that occurs in their country and to be able to have an idea of the factors that influence gun violence. This is very important, and we believe that increasing awareness of self-protection is also an integral part of preventing injuries and deaths. We hope that our findings will be brought to the attention of politicians, not only of society. The issue of gun control has always been controversial. While gun ownership is a legal right of citizens, gun control laws play an important role. Each mass shooting in the United States has brought the issue of gun control back to public attention. Our findings provide evidentiary support for the link between current gun control laws and gun violence, but we argue that current gun control efforts may be flawed and inadequate. We hope that politicians and lawmakers can give careful consideration and improve current gun control efforts.
In a country as diverse as the United States, gun control laws, demographics, and social circumstances are different in each state. Our analysis is limited and may not cover every situation, but we hope that gun control will become a social issue that is taken seriously. Gun violence affects everyone around us, as well as us as students. In the recent gun violence that occurred around the University of Washington in Seattle, the victims were students. This reinforces our hope that people will become more aware of gun violence and that politicians will increase gun control. Gun violence happens every day, it's just that when it's not happening around us, we may forget that people are getting hurt and people are dying. Victims should be given more attention, and this protects the potential victim population.

## **Conclusion**
Through our project, the issue of gun violence is truly one that cannot be ignored. In particular, the rising trend in the frequency of gun violence in recent years is well worth the attention of the public as well as politicians. 
The main research direction of our project is to analyze the factors affecting gun violence, the groups of victims of gun violence, and the trends in the occurrence of gun violence. Since the groups we expect to present our project to are the public and politicians, we designed three interactive charts that each show our main focus, with the aim of making our findings more visual to the user. Users can interact with the charts by selecting different features and comparing the differences in results between the different choices. For example, in the boxplot on gun violence casualties vs. gun control laws, users can select the presence or absence of gun control laws to see the difference in gun violence casualties and thus gain a visual understanding of whether gun control is effective in reducing gun violence casualties.
We hope that after viewers see our project, it will generate thoughts about gun violence in the United States. As a social issue, gun violence should not only be known, but politicians should take action to change the current situation and protect more citizens from the fear of gun violence. A perfect social system should allow citizens to live safely and peacefully while having freedom.


## **Expected Implications**
If our research questions are answered, this could pressure policymakers to intake the severity of gun violence in America and usher them to change policies. It would give them a clearer indication of which locations need added or stricter laws. They’ll know which laws are not working by viewing the effectiveness it has on keeping gun violence numbers low. Another policy that could be drawn from the data is policy that reduces poverty. By reducing poverty, this poverty could reduce the amount of violence as well.

The implications for technologists are that this data visualization can bring awareness for developing technology to reduce gun violence. We can develop technology for gun sensors to reduce gun violence. Software can be developed to bring awareness about gun violence against certain groups. It can provide services in helping these communites stay safe.

For designers, this data can have implications on the way design security systems are made to account for gun control.

## **Limitations**

A limitation could be that not every instance could be reported in the data set. This could be because people are afraid to report acts of gun violence to save themselves from legal trouble. A limitation for the poverty data set  is that it does not delve full detail into the cities of certain states. This is a limitation because many states have some cities below the poverty line and cities that are above the poverty line. It does not give a detailed glimpse into the full extent of poverty with guns. A limitation with the data sets is that most of them only go up until 2018, therefore we cannot do data analysis on more recent events.

## **Appendix A: Questions**
We have 2 data sets that doesn't meet the requirements of over 10 columns and over 130 observations. Instead, there's only 50 observations for each states. Is that okay?
